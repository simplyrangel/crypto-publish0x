**Analysis steps:**
1. Run `generate-dispersions.py` to generate and plot rebase rewards rate dispersions based on OIP-63. The dispersions are saved to `bin/rebase-rate-estimates.csv`. 
2. Run `ohm-accrual.py` to model the Ohm accrued throughout 2022, and calculate the break even price at every rebase event based on a 1-Ohm purchased 2022-01-09.
